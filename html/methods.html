                            does popular stores among yelp reviewers really contribute to the livelyhood of physical space?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inspired by this question, we download review data from 15,000+ stores in Manhattan from Yelp,
                            and then we aggregate these reviews by physical street segments. In this way we could compare the aggregated online popularity
                            with the number of actual visits along these streets, here is what we found:

                    <li><h2>Model Construction</h2>
                        <p> To test how much does online reviews actually contribute to physical acitivites, we include other
                            variables in the model.</p>
                            <p>  * <strong>Physical Characteristics: </strong> <em>Does Beautiful Space Matter?</em></p>
                            <p>  * <strong>Business Diversity and Transit: </strong><em>Jane Jacobs still right?</em> </p>
                            <p>  * <strong>Local Business: </strong> <em>How are local businesses doing?</em></p>
                            <p>  * <strong>X: </strong> <em>We control other variables.</em></p><br>

                            <p>The graph below shows our preliminary results. The height of the bar indicates the significance of
                                each variable (how precise they are), and the length of the bar shows the effectiveness of each variable
                                (how much they contribute to the model). For example, the average star in each street increase 1 unit is
                                associated with around 35% increase in the offline visitor volume. But once the average star goes beyond 3.4, it
                                starts to associate with the decrease of offline visitor volume (refer to the quadratic term).

                        <p> This model was able to achieve around 40% R-square, sigh... Then it means there are a lot
                            of variance could not be explained even after we control the neighborhood variables! Therefore,
                            use this model's residual, we define a O2O mismatch index, which is the residual from the OLS model
                            regressing the total street level visit on online reviews (including the number of reviews and the stars)
                            and other built environment factors.

                            See acknowledgement for further detail of the mobility pattern data.
                            We aggregate the POI level visit pattern data from October to December in 2019 for each poi
                            for our analysis.
             
                            Our review data are downloaded from Yelp. We use the number of reviews, review stars and claimed closed stores 
                            for all listings in Manhattan district to estimate the online popularity.

                            To make the two data comparable, we only select businesses that are coded in retail, restaurants, hotels and arts & recreaction
                            according to the official <a href="https://www.naics.com/search/">NAICS code</a> (44,45,71,72).

                            This work used a deep learning model created by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.020">Zhang et al. (2018)</a>.
                            With the model and 6,708 street view images in Manhattan, we predict the beauty index of each images, and then aggregate
                            the beauty score by each street segment. The beauty score was normalized.

                            Does COVID-19 change anything? We are hoping to compare the activity in the past three months as a comparison.
