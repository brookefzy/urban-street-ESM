                        <p> <strong>“We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.” </strong>
                            Diversity is intrinsic to a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive city. The probability of meeting diverse groups
                             of others also shape our own path self-development. Cities have learned to build mixed-income housing to encourage 
                             people with different socioeconomic status to meet each other. However, so far we have not leverage any specific planning 
                             tools to encourage a diverse experience through our daily life. In view of this gap, our research team focus on a very 
                             unique spatial unit, the urban street sidewalk, to construct a Experienced Social Mixing (ESM) index to understand the 
                             likelihood of us meeting people with different income backgrounds.

                        <h2>Construct the ESM</h2>
                        <p> Our measure of ESM is constructed from a privacy-enhanced mobility dataset provided by Cuebiq, which includes 
                            3-month long records across two years of anonymized device-level location pings for 0.5 million users. 
                            To construct the ESM, we pre-process the data to identify each device's home Census Block Group (CBG) and 
                            stay locations using the same method in a previous work by Moro et al.(2020). 
                            We first associate each device from the mobility dataset with an approximate socioeconomic status by their 
                            inferred home CBG. Each individual's home CBG is obtained from their most commonly visited location between 
                            10 pm to 6 am. Then all individuals are grouped into four quantiles of income groups according 
                            to their home CBG's median household income's relation to the metropolitan area distribution of median household 
                            income. We then extract visits an individual made to a given street segment for at least 5 minutes 
                            but a maximum of two hours. This is to prioritize sidewalk activities that have the potential for meaningful 
                            interaction among pedestrians. Activities such as visiting cafes, restaurants, parks, or simply resting along 
                            the streets are emphasized.
