                Urban density is long considered to foster diverse exchanges of interpersonal knowledge and skills, 
                which are intrinsic to sustainable human settlements. However, with current urban studies primarily 
                devoted to city and district-level analysis, we cannot unveil the elemental connection between urban 
                density and diversity. Here we use an anonymized and privacy-enhanced mobile data set of 0.5 million 
                opted-in users from three metropolitan areas in the U.S to show that at the scale of urban streets, 
                density is not the only path to diversity. We represent the diversity of each street with the Experienced 
                Social Mixing (ESM), which describes the chances of people meeting diverse income groups throughout their 
                daily experience. We conduct multiple experiments and show that the concentration of visitors only explains 
                26% of street-level ESM. However, adjacent amenities, residential diversity, and income level account for 44% 
                of the ESM. Moreover, using longitudinal business data, we show that streets with an increased number of food
                 businesses have seen an increased ESM from 2016 to 2018. Lastly, although streets with more visitors are more 
                 likely to have crime, diverse streets tend to have fewer crimes. These findings suggest that cities can 
                 leverage many tools beyond density to curate a diverse and safe street experience for people.
