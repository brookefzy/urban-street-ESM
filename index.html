                What makes a street more diverse?</h2>
            <p>
                Urban density is long considered to foster diverse exchanges of interpersonal knowledge and skills, 
                which are intrinsic to sustainable human settlements. 
                However, with current urban studies primarily devoted to city and district-level analysis, 
                we cannot unveil the elemental connection between urban density and diversity. 
                What makes a street more diverse? The <strong>Great Streets</strong> project uses high-resolution anonymous mobility data to quantify 
                the income diversity of streets in urban areas. Our research shows that street diversity is not only linked to the 
                concentration of visitors but rather to the kind of amenities, residential diversity, and income level around them. As a result, turning the corner can take you to a completely different diverse area.
